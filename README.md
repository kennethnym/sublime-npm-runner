# NpmRunner

NpmRunner is a Sublime Text 3/4 plugin that lets you run NPM scripts in a project through Sublime Text's Command Palette.

## Installation

You can install this plugin through Package Control.

## Integration with Terminus

If [Terminus](https://github.com/randy3k/Terminus) is installed, NpmRunner will display script outputs through a Terminus panel for better output formatting.

Otherwise, a plain panel is used to display script outputs. The output will not have any formatting. It is therefore recommended to use NpmRunner alongside Terminus for the best experience.
